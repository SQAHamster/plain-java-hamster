## Introduction

The Hamstersimulator is a variant of the Hamstersimulator for teaching programming initiated by D. Bohles at the University of Oldenburg. This variant here used the original ideas but uses a pure OO-API and utilizes features of modern Java versions and libraries (JDK >= 14). In addition, it brings objects-first to the Hamstersimulator as described in the programming teaching book "Touch of Class" by B. Meyer.
